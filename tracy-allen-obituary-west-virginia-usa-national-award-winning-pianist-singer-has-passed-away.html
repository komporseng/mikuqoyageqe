Presently a resident of Alderson, she will perform “Mendelssohn, Mozart, and Mail,” a one-hour concert with a brief intermission, at VILLA JOY, 204 Davis St., Alderson, on Friday, October 20 at 7 p.m. The suggested per-person donation is $20. Since the age of fourteen, she has served as the choir accompanist for Methodist church choirs and has graduated from Greenbrier East High School with honors in madrigal and choir.</p><p>Allen, who over the years participated in numerous regional talent exhibitions and one national piano competition, achieved victory in two of them and finished in the running for the remainder. “The majority of my discipline was instilled in me by Lewisburg native and The Julliard School alumnus Frank Belin,” Allen said in a press release. Allen is a determined woman, juggling the responsibilities of accompanying the current Sunday congregation at Johnson Memorial United Methodist Church in Alderson, working full time as a mail carrier for the past 21 years, finding time to practice, and producing vibrant and upbeat artwork for local festivals.</p><p>Sophie Pace, director and proprietor of VILLA JOY, remarked, “I consider myself fortunate to have Tracy listed on the roster.” Allen’s preferred composer is Chopin, and she plans to perform Chopin alongside Mendelssohn, Bach, Mozart, and a few unexpected artists at the inaugural House Concert at VILLA JOY, an eclectic studio, gallery, connecting, and gathering space that debuted on Davis Street on May 3rd. There are restricted indoor seats available for the hour-long concert. Bring a blanket or garden chair for use as outdoor seating. “I am ecstatic to preside over this inaugural concert,” Pace exclaimed. “I sincerely hope that many more will follow.”</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwwNGamrJlkaG5prqMqJmirKWWv7p51p6qrWWmnr%2Botc2imGato5Z6r63ToqanmZxirrit0Z1ksKGeo7avs4ypoJqmmajBbr%2FIp56eql2drrR5z5qqrJ2UYq64rdho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
