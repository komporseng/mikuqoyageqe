beaten and have dropped points on only three occasions.</p><p>It is 36 years since the Black Sea Star last lifted the Turkish championship, and if they are to get over the line this season, managing tough periods in matches will be crucial to their hopes.</p><p>That is exactly what they did in their last runout against Fenerbahce, where Trabzonspor came from behind to score twice in the final five minutes to steal a crucial win over their fellow title hopefuls.</p><p>Goals late on from <a href=# title="More Yusuf Sari"><strong class=autotag>Yusuf Sari</strong></a> and <a href=# title="More Anastasios Bakasetas"><strong class=autotag>Anastasios Bakasetas</strong></a> helped Trabzonspor leapfrog the record Turkish champions in the table, taking them to the top for the first time this season.</p><p>They now hold a slender two point lead over Fenerbahce and will get the chance to extend that to five, before the club from Istanbul play on Sunday evening.</p><p><a href=# title="More Abdullah Avci"><strong class=autotag>Abdullah Avci</strong></a> should be confident his side will be able to make it five wins from six away matches on Saturday, given their impressive head-to-head record over Goztepe.</p><p>Trabzonspor have lost just one of their previous five encounters with Goz Goz and are unbeaten at the Gursel Aksel Stadi since August 2017 – a run of three matches.</p><p>Regardless of how they have fared over the previous years against Trabzonspor, Goztepe’s form this season has not shown anything to suggest they would be able to uproot the league leaders.</p><p>Their 2-1 triumph over Kasimpasa at the weekend was only their second victory of the campaign, having previously lost the last four matches since beating Istanbul Basaksehir back in early September.</p><p>The Basaksehir game remains their only home win of the season so far, with Goztepe having won just one of their previous eight Super Lig matches at the Gursel Aksel Stadi.</p><p>Unlikely to find the remedy for their poor home form this weekend, Goztepe will look towards their upcoming fixtures against relegation rivals should they wish to pick up the points needed to extend their four-year stay in the first tier.</p><p>Goztepe SK Turkish Super Lig form:</p><ul class=fg_results><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_draw

already.</p><p>Similarly, summer signing <a href=# title="More Andreas Cornelius"><strong class=autotag>Andreas Cornelius</strong></a> has started the season in fine fashion, scoring three Super Lig
