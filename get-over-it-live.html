Eagles Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴I turn on the tube and what do I see
A whole lotta people cryin' &#34;Don't blame me&#34;
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your momma's too thin; your daddy's too fatGet over it Get over it
All this whinin' and cryin' and pitchin' a fit"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics express frustration with people who constantly play the victim and complain instead of taking responsibility for their lives. The opening lines of the song illustrate this sentiment when the singer turns on the TV and sees people who are always crying and blaming others for their problems. It paints a picture of a world where everyone is looking for someone else to blame.</p><br><p>The use of the phrase "get over it" throughout the song is a challenge to listeners to stop complaining and move on. The song asks people to stop playing the victim and stop blaming others for their problems. The line "You don't want to work, you want to live like a king / But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing" is a reminder of the harsh realities of life, that we have to work hard to achieve our dreams and not expect them to be handed to us on a silver platter. The song takes a dig at people who are always complaining and points out how counterproductive this attitude is.</p><br><p>In addition, the song's bridge makes fun of people who wallow in guilt and pain and wear it like a badge of honor. The singer points out that complaining and blaming others for one's problems do not help and instead bring everyone else down. The song's message is clear: stop blaming others for one's problems, take responsibility for one's actions, and focus on moving forward.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I turn on the tube and what do I see</u><br>I turn on the TV and see many people blaming others for their problems.</p><br><p><u>A whole lotta people cryin' "Don't blame me"</u><br>Many people are complaining that they are not to blame for their problems.</p><br><p><u>They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else</u><br>These people are pointing their fingers at others instead of taking responsibility for their own issues.</p><br><p><u>Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves</u><br>These people waste their time pitying themselves instead of fixing their problems.</p><br><p><u>Victim of this, victim of that</u><br>These people blame external factors for their problems and don't take responsibility for their own life.</p><br><p><u>Your momma's too thin; your daddy's too fat</u><br>These people complain about things that they cannot control.</p><br><p><u>Get over it</u><br>Stop complaining and take responsibility for your life.</p><br><p><u>You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash</u><br>You blame your problems on a past accident that affected you.</p><br><p><u>But you might feel better if they gave you some cash</u><br>You think that you would be happier if someone gave you money.</p><br><p><u>The more I think about it, Old Billy was right</u><br>I agree with Old Billy that we should eliminate lawyers.</p><br><p><u>Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight</u><br>This line does not convey actual intentions and is only a humorous one-liner.</p><br><p><u>You don't want to work; you want to live like a king</u><br>You prefer living a luxurious life without putting in the work to achieve it.</p><br><p><u>But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing</u><br>You cannot expect the world to provide you with everything you desire.</p><br><p><u>If you don't want to play, then you might as well split</u><br>If you don't want to contribute or work hard, then it's better if you leave the situation altogether.</p><br><p><u>It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak</u><br>You keep complaining about your problems as if you are confessing them to someone.</p><br><p><u>You're makin' the most of your losin' streak</u><br>You keep focusing on your failures instead of finding solutions to your problems.</p><br><p><u>Some call it sick, but I call it weak</u><br>Some consider your behavior sick, but I think it's just weak.</p><br><p><u>You drag it around like a ball and chain</u><br>You carry your problems with you like a burden and it's holding you back.</p><br><p><u>You wallow in the guilt; you wallow in the pain</u><br>You are dwelling in your negative feelings instead of moving past them.</p><br><p><u>You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown</u><br>You show off your problems to gain sympathy from others.</p><br><p><u>Got your mind in the gutter, bringin' everybody down</u><br>Your negative attitude is affecting others and bringing them down too.</p><br><p><u>Complain about the present and blame it on the past</u><br>You blame your present problems on past events and refuse to move on.</p><br><p><u>I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass</u><br>This line is not meant to be taken seriously and is just a humorous exaggeration.</p><br><p><u>All this bitchin' and moanin' and pitchin' a fit</u><br>You are complaining and throwing tantrums about your problems.</p><br><p><u>It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit</u><br>You need to stop complaining and take action to fix your problems.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Cass County Music / Wisteria Music / Privet Music, Red Cloud Music, Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: GLENN FREY, DON HENLEY</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH2RnLmmv46AnK2Xn6uys6vIrZZhhJmrsmo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
