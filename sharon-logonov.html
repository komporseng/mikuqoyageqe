Here we bring our viewers about one such personality who gained much prominence with the name of Jones. Yes, you've guessed right <strong>Sharon Jones</strong> whose maiden name is <strong>Sharon Logonov</strong>, a former wife of baseball honcho Chipper Jones.</p><p>Sharon Jones was born to an American family. But, she has not detailed her date of birth. She holds an American nationality and belongs to the white ethnicity. Similarly, she has not also revealed her family or education to the media.</p><p>Talking about her career, she could be frequently seen with her husband <a href=#><strong>Chipper Jones</strong></a><strong> </strong>while in the fields. It seems like she was involved in managing her hubby's business profile. As a good wife, she was involved in caring for her other half. As of now, she might be busy in her daily life nurturing her children.</p><h2>Sharon and Chipper Love life</h2><p>Sharon Logonov has not mentioned how she met the man of her dream. But it is for sure that Sharon&nbsp;and Jones started seeing each other in early 1999. At that time, Jones was a rising star, and Sharon was a beauty queen, and their love happened in the air, and the bond grew stronger and stronger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/22/Chipper-Jones%20(1)-1671707319921.jpeg><p>After dating for a while, the couple took a step further by tying the knot. The duo had a grand wedding in March 2000 in Pierson, Florida.</p><p>Following that, the Jones family was blessed with their first child <strong>Trey Jones</strong> in 2000. Further, the second baby girl <a href=#><strong>Shea Jones</strong></a> was born in 2004, and the third infant <a href=#><strong>Tristen Jones </strong></a>was born in 2005. The hubby-wife duo had an intimate relationship sharing love.</p><h3>What Was The Reason For Their Separation?</h3><p>Everything was going very well between the romantic duo, Sharon&nbsp;and Jones. In the initial stage, they had a very strong marriage relationship, and they showed no sign of separation.</p><p>But, slowly, the couple started to have a difference in their relationship. This change in their marital relationship became a nightmare when the couple went for a mutually accepted divorce. Similarly, on November 16, 2012, the couple got separated after being together for over 13 years and eight months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/7/21/Taylor_and_chipper-1563682238132.jpg><p>Before Jones's marriage to Sharon, he was married to <a href=#><strong>Karin Fulford</strong></a>. However, his cheating with a hotel waitress and his secret love child led to divorce. Jones is currently in a marital relationship with former Playboy model <a href=#><strong>Taylor Higgins</strong></a> and has two children, <strong>Cutler Ridge Jones</strong> and <strong>Cooper Jones</strong>. As of now, they live a happy married life.</p><h2>Is Sharon&nbsp;Dating Anyone At Present?</h2><p>Sharon Logonov preferred to live a low-profiled life after being separated from her ex-husband Chipper Jones. She seems to live a single and prominent life after her separation.</p><p>As you might know, she is not available on any of the social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram and Facebook. So it becomes very hard to track her personal life.</p><h2>Sharon Net worth</h2><p>Sharon Logonov has an estimated net worth of over <strong>$500,000</strong>. On the other hand, her former husband, Chipper Jones, has a whooping asset of over <strong>$110 million</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, he has also invested an enormous amount in the entertainment business. As an MLB player, he earned a salary of over <strong>$13 million</strong>, making him the highest-earning baseball player of that time.</p><h2>Sharon Logonov Age & Body Measurements (Height, Weight)</h2><p>Sharon has a slim body figure with an average body weight of 60 kg (132 lbs) and a decent height of 5 feet 7 inches (173 cm). Similarly, she has blonde hair, and her eyes are brown in colour.</p><p>Likewise, Chipper Jones&nbsp;stands 6 feet 3 inches tall with an average body weight of 95 kg (193 cm). He has brown eyes and light&nbsp;brown hair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stay Connected To </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Marriedceleb </strong></a><strong>Know More About Celebrity Spouse.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqyfmqqfo3qtu8aopaiu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
