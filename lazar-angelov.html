Lazar’s inspiration to get fit and strong came from watching a lot of action movies. While growing up, Lazar emulated his big screen heroes. As a young not, he involved himself with basketball and weight training.&nbsp; Lazar would complete two sessions of basketball training, one in the morning and the other one in the afternoon. The weights session was always in the middle of the day.</p><p>At the time, he knew nothing about nutrition. He actually passed out a couple of times.

Though he has had some very tough periods in his life, he has gone through them all and is ready to overcome anything that life throws at him.

Lazar loves keeping his fats high, both saturated and unsaturated. He says that this helps him to keep his testosterone high, which in turn, helps in burning fat and retaining muscle mass. There was a time when Lazar would diet using the ketogenic method. However, he no more prefers that method because it reduces muscle mass and body fat. Lazar now prefers to go for very long periods on a low-carb approach to get the best results.

Although those two jobs didn’t pay well, he kept on pushing and focusing on his goals of creating his physique of greatness. Lazar admits that it was hard work with long periods of little or no rest.</p><p>It was hard because he didn’t get enough rest, but it was worth it because it paid off. Achieving his dreams was no easy task, but maintaining what he has achieved, and the hours he has dedicated to making his dream into a reality is just as hard. Most people believe that once you have achieved the body that you always wanted, everything else comes easy after that. In fact, the hardest part is maintaining your physique over a long period of time.</p><p>It costs Lazar as much effort to stay in his shape as it cost him to achieve it. He has to give 100% all the time and if he starts living as most people do, he will quickly get out of shape. In terms of training intensity for Ectomorphs, Lazar likes to train heavily and with a lot of intensity. regardless of whether he’s cutting or bulking. “If you’re someone with an ectomorph body type, then you should be using heavy weights to maintain good muscle density”. Says Lazar.</p><p>There’s generally no set rule for his training routine for days of the week. Lazar listens to his body and if he needs to rest he’ll rest, but if he needs to train a certain muscle group, he’ll make sure he targets that area. Lazar is able to do this because of the years of knowing his own body and what works best for him. He always incorporates basic exercises such as squats, bench presses, and deadlifts in his training routine. However, he always tries to make them different each time to provoke new muscle responses.</p><h2>Lazar Angelov Injury | Surgery</h2><p>He suddenly stopped training between late 2020 and early 2021 and many of his followers were confused and curious to know what happened to this Bulgarian bodybuilder and model who rose to fame when online fitness became a hit.
