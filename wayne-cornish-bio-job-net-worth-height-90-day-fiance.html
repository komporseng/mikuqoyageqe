After the show’s premiere, fans have been wondering if they are still together. In addition to that, we’ll discuss his age, job, and net worth in this article below.</p><p>So, keep scrolling down to learn more about 90 Day Fiance star Wayne.</p><h3><strong>Wayne Cornish On 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</strong></h3><p>90-Day Fiance: The Other Way season 5 premiered in July 2023. Wayne Cornish and his fiancee <a href=#>Holly Weeks</a> are among the six couples we meet this season.</p><p>In the show, Wayne has been described as “a hard worker” and “has been on his own since he was 17.” He worked for everything he had and didn’t have a privileged life. Holly believes that her partner is a genuinely good person and she respects everything about him.</p><p>Because Holly had always wished to wed someone who shared her religious convictions so that they could communicate with one another, they first connected on a Jehovah’s Witness dating service. Wayne started online dating because he was tired of all the girls and he searched for a Witness girl, became friends with her, see where it goes.</p><p>Holly calls herself a “Rapunzel hair girl”, and believes in that fairy tale. “Ever since I was little I loved fairytales and Rapunzel was one of my favorite,” she shared. With her hair which is about “70 inches long,” a woman even told her that she should be in a circus.</p><p>Holly loves traveling and that passion of hers helped Wayne meet his future wife.</p><p>She got a job as a barber in Ogden, Utah. She has been married twice before which didn’t last very long. Now, she believes that Wayne is the one for her if they could over the challenges that obstruct their journey of being together.</p><h3><strong>Are Wayne Cornish And Holly Weeks Still Together?</strong></h3><p>On Instagram, Holly Weeks and Wayne Cornish still follow each other. It, therefore, indicates that they are still together.</p><p>To start off, Holly didn’t want to date a guy from Utah and she also wanted to travel so, she started online dating. Then she met her partner Wayne, from Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><p>When they started talking to each other they were on the phone for hours. He believed that being able to communicate for hours meant they certainly had some type of connection with each other. After six months into talking on a video call, Holly went to Africa to meet Wayne.</p><p>They had an undeniable chemistry.</p><p>“When I get to South Africa, I’m marrying Wayne in a week,” Holly said on the season 5 premiere. “I know it’s really quick, but we’re really ready. And, we’re waiting until we’re married to have sex, and so we’re excited to do that as well.”</p><p>For Wayne, it was the connection he had never felt, and believed Holly might be the one he is going to marry. Within three days of meeting in person, Wayne proposed. He proposed to her and she ran away because Holly was frightened.</p><p>Prior to it, Holly’s American mother had gone to South Africa with her with the intention of practically sleeping in Wayne’s bed to deter any temptation. And Holly’s mother planned to stay for a full three months (i.e., two months and three weeks after the hasty marriage), so it wouldn’t be a quick journey either.</p><p>“I’m all for it ’cause I want to start our relationship on the right foot,” Wayne said of meeting — and living with — Holly’s mom. He also acknowledged it might feel “uncomfortable,” saying, “You don’t want your mother-in-law with you, living by you when you’re married newly.”</p><p>Now to be with Wayne, Holly has to give up her life in the States and moved to South Africa because Wayne is not leaving his business and his dad behind. Her friends think that it just can’t happen. Her friend told her that she and Holly’s family won’t be able to help her in any way if she ever found herself in grave trouble.</p><p>Holly has a first-hand experience with what her friend was talking about because she got robbed in Africa. The rob happened during a black-out caused by strain on the power grid. After Holly left, Wayne was robbed again and Holly believed it was “the scariest place to live in the world.”</p><h3><strong>Wayne Cornish Age</strong></h3><p>Wayne Cornish, as he revealed on the show, Wayne Cornish is 40 years of age.
