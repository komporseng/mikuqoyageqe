The woman <strong>Kevin Hart</strong>, 38, may have allegedly gotten cozy&nbsp;with sexy singer <strong>Monique, </strong>according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTO</a>. The gorgeous Latina singer has taken Miami by storm with her amazing songs like “Si Tu Boquita” and “Lost In You”, and it’s rumored that she allegedly spent time with Kevin. There’s no doubt about it: Monique is the total package — pretty, talented, smart, and confident. Her career is on fire right now, too. Monique performed at the massive&nbsp;Soulfrito Urban Latin Music Fest at Barclays Center in NYC on June 9, alongside artists like <strong>Rick Ross</strong> and <strong>Fetty Wap</strong>. She recorded a song with <strong>Pitbull</strong>, as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rumors started after Kevin was spotted sliding into a car with a beautiful brunette — &nbsp;allegedly Monique — at his hotel in Miami in the early, early hours of July 18. Kevin allegedly spent about 20 minutes in the Lexus luxury car with his sexy companion, at one point even allegedly moving over to the passenger seat to get closer to her! Scandalous!&nbsp;“It’s obvious they were up to no good,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a source told Radar Online, which has video</a>. “She kept looking over her shoulder and Kevin was pop-eyed when another guest walked by.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Whoa! Those are some serious allegations! The outlet had video of Kevin in the car, but it doesn’t show anything untoward. There’s no kissing or anything else inappropriate shown. It’s possible that the woman and Kevin are friends hanging out in Miami. Men and women are allowed to be friends, you know! Kevin has vehemently denied doing anything wrong, saying on Instagram that he’s staying above the “BS”. And Monique has also spoken out, saying it’s all been blown out of proportion. “When they make something out of nothing you just gotta laugh,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she told Power 96 In Miami.</a> “I know who I am and my truth.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> has reached out to Kevin and Monique reps for comment but have not gotten a response.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you shocked that Kevin allegedly cheated on his wife with Monique? Let us know!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH14e5FpZqSdpp67brTAq6tmm5iarrW1zaBksKGknXquu82iqK6dXai2r7PEq2SwoZaaeqa6yKSmZqiRp7%2Bqv8dmp6Kbo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
