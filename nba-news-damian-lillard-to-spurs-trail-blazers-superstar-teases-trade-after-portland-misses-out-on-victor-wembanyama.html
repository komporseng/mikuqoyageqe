Trail Blazers superstar TEASES TRADE after Portland misses out on Victor We</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-04</div><p>The NBA Draft for the next season is already laid out. The teams who failed to make an impact this season competed for the top draft picks in the NBA Draft lottery. The top four picks were mainly contested by four teams with a rather poor season. The<strong> Houston Rockets</strong>,<strong> Portland Trailblazers</strong>,<strong> Charlotte Hornets</strong> and<strong> San</strong> <strong>Antonio Spurs</strong> all hoped to get the number one pick. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Spurs walked away with it </a>as they are now predicted to draft the young sensation from France, <strong>Victor Wembanyama</strong>.</p><p>Following the Draft lottery, social media, fans, and critics were all buzzing around the Spurs. The young French player is the top prospect, according to general consensus. Therefore, the Spurs are now favored to draft the dynamic player to their roster. Out of the many people excited for Wembanyama’s draft, Portland Trail Blazers star <strong>Damian Lillard</strong> got fans in a bit of a frenzy with a little potential trade tease.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Although there hasn’t been a concrete confirmation, fans are suspecting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Damian Lillard</a> to demand a trade. This speculation comes after Lillard’s recent response to a fan tweet. The fan questioned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Wembanyama</a>-Damian Lillard team-up. Although, after Portland failed to acquire the first pick, it seemed unlikely at first. However, Lillard then responded by saying, “If so…,” leaving fans confused and excited.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A.

However, the Trail Blazers star has been extremely loyal to his franchise. The guard was drafted by Portland in 2012 and has played for them ever since.</p><p>Although the Blazers haven’t won a championship, Lillard has been exceptional for them. However, after a very disappointing 2022-23 NBA season, Lillard expressed his displeasure with the organization.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=#>#Sixers</a> are a team to watch for landing Damian Lillard this offseason if James Harden leaves in free agency, an NBA scout told <a href=#>@KevinMcCNBA</a>.</p><p>Lillard has “pondered” the idea of playing for Philadelphia before, the scout added. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0WCTfoZVB7</a></p>— Philly Sixers Galaxy (@sixers_galaxy) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Lillard expressed the urgency to take championship contention seriously. He also mentioned that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Trailblazers are facing an important offseason</a> in terms of making a championship roster.</p><p>There’s no doubt that the guard is hungry to win a championship ring and would go to any extent to make a statement. Moreover, with Portland not getting the first pick, they are unlikely to make a significant change to their roster. It could be assumed that he would demand a trade. However, his landing zone would still not be clear. As of now, Lillard is still very closed off and secretive about his trade intentions.</p><p><strong>In case you missed:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBusMCmoJqmXaG2rbjAq5tmrJ9iwLHB0axkraqRnrlursuasZ6qo2LAtrzEq6qtmaJiwaat0p6qZqyilrGmecCfq56qXaW8s8DLmqWdZZ2ewLSx0mamrqxdpLtuwsicq6iqXayyrq7Ap7CapZFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
