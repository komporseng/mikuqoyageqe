I waited for a few in-game weeks and other Attack of the Fanboy writers also did the same with no call to be had, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it felt like a roulette trying to guess the wait time</a>. Instead, <strong>what I found works for receiving a call is just playing through different gigs and activities (just a few) then eventually you will get a call</strong>.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Where to Find Tier 4 Item Components in Cyberpunk 2077</a></p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>The <strong>first call you will get is from Reed</strong> after you effectively betrayed him by making the choice to side with Songbird. Once you go through the dialogue, simply go back to completing various other activities, and then <strong>you will get a call from So Mi</strong> to go and meet her at a particular location. <strong>Travel to the marker marker and you will be ready to start the main section of the quest</strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Does It Matter What You Say On the Phone With Reed in The Killing Moon?</h3><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false><strong>No, you can choose whatever options you would like on the phone call with Reed</strong> as it does not matter either way. There are other sections (later on in The Killing Moon quest) where you want to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">be more careful with your dialogue options</a> but at this stage, it is just Reed threatening to find both you and Songbird.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Build Lucy From Cyberpunk Edgerunners in Cyberpunk 2077</a></p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=false>Now that you know how long to wait for Songbird to call in Phantom Liberty, you can get back into the game and help So Mi even more.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
