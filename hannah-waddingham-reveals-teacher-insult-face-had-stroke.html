“Ted Lasso” star Hannah Waddingham’s former teacher said she would never have a career on TV — due to her physical appearance.
“I had one drama teacher that said to the whole class: ‘Oh Hannah will never work on-screen because she looks like one side of her face has had a stroke,’ ” Waddingham, 49, told Michelle Visage on her BBC podcast “Rule Breakers.” “I thought, ‘I will do."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Why should I be constantly feeding into someone else’s storyline?’ ” she said.</p><p>“So I said to my agents at the time, ‘I’m not doing it anymore . . . If it’s one scene, I’m not doing it anymore, and you shouldn’t be putting me up for it, because it’s insulting,’ ” Waddingham continued. “I’ve been a leading lady for 22 years. I’m not doing it anymore. I’d rather be in a world where I’m appreciated.’”</p><p>Waddingham “fully stepped back” from acting at one point, before landing the role of Septa Unella on “Game of Thrones,” which she played in seasons 5 and 6.</p><p>Waddingham has been keeping busy since “Ted Lasso” ended with Season 3 last year. Up next, she’s set to star in and executive produce a new eight-episode comedy Prime Video series from creator Tessa Coates alongside Octavia Spencer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmam9fmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvHmqWnmZhixKKww6KloKCRonqzsdWemKWrXamyoq%2FHnqlmoZ6owq3AjJ%2BYnJ1dna6ledKtqaijlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
