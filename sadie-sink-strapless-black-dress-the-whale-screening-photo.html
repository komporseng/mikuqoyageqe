Leading man Brendan has become an early awards season front-runner for his performance in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Darren Aronofsky</strong></a> film. The Whale follows the life of Charlie, a reclusive 600lb English teacher looking to reconnect with his daughter (Sadie) as he battles increasingly troubling health issues.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Brendan’s performance is clearly one to be watched, the Encino Man actor also had major praise for co-star Sadie. Talking up her acting skills in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video for GQ</a> in mid-November, he said, “The fluidity that Sadie plays, this beautiful, controlled rage, was breathtaking to me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In fact, her performances were so evocative, Brendan admitted he would sometimes forget his dialogue. “I was constantly going up on my lines,” he revealed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“And that’s just because I have cobwebs upstairs and I was wearing a lot of gear, but also because I was just slack-jawed. I’m not joking,” he went on, adding, “Watching her work — she won the game ball every day we worked, I’m telling you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5JpZqyZlJ6ybr%2FIp6Jmq6SnrrG4xKyqZpqclrCsecOrnKyrXam1pnnWoZilnV2osLOxxKegp59dpbWwwM5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
