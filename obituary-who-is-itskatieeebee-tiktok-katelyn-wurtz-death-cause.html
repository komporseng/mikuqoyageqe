Fans of Paul McComas, who was well-known for his use of multiple social media platforms, established a GoFundMe page in his honor after he passed away. The majority of what contributed to him becoming renowned was his TikTok and Reels on house wholesaling.
This account detailed several facets of his life as well as his company. As the parent of six children, he reasoned that it would be entertaining to show the world that it is possible to become successful on one’s own without devoting one’s entire life to the pursuit of making the fortunes of others."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Obituary And Death Cause Of The Tiktok Star</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-14</div><p><strong>Paul Mccomas: Who Was He? Obituary And Death Cause Of The Tiktok Star</strong></p><p>Fans of Paul McComas, who was well-known for his use of multiple social media platforms, established a GoFundMe page in his honor after he passed away. The majority of what contributed to him becoming renowned was his TikTok and Reels on house wholesaling.</p><p>This account detailed several facets of his life as well as his company. As the parent of six children, he reasoned that it would be entertaining to show the world that it is possible to become successful on one’s own without devoting one’s entire life to the pursuit of making the fortunes of others.</p><p>The unfortunate fact is that Paul’s name is currently trending on the internet not because of his videos or his advise, but rather because of a horrible event. Recent reports indicate that the YouTube personality passed suddenly at an unfortunate age.</p><p>Paul was well-known in the community for his work as a financial advisor, and as a result of his videos, he became popular on the platform TikTok. However, unfortunately, he is no longer with his family and the people that loved him.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-58758 alt="Paul Mccomas" width=224 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Paul-Mccomas.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-58758 class=wp-caption-text>Paul Mccomas</p><h2>GoFundMe page created in memory of Paul Mccomas and to raise money towards his funeral</h2><p>According to obituary writings seen on the internet, Paul Mccomas passed away much too soon. In addition, there is a GoFundMe page in his name that can be seen online. He had been living in the Spender area of Tennessee.</p><p>It is speculated that he died in a car crash, although this information cannot be independently verified at this time. It was reportedly on the 30th of August in 2022 that he went away.</p><p>On TikTok, he was the huge, bearded, and curly-haired real estate agent who demonstrated how I went from being a grease monkey to selling paper with NO MONEY. He did this by telling the story of how he went from being a grease monkey to selling paper.</p><p>One of the sentences that he would say over and over again was, “Keep it simple, don’t overthink it, and get out of your brain.” After that, he continued along same lines and mentioned how that was the secret to his success in wholesaling houses.</p><p>Not only was he an unidentified YouTuber or content provider, but people actually paid attention to what he had to say and followed his recommendations. His followers took his recommendations to heart and even flooded the comment section with positive feedback.</p><h2>In the year that he passed away, how old was Paul Mccomas?</h2><p>Paul Mccomas looks to be in his forties in the most current images that have surfaced of him. However, there is a possibility that the estimate is inaccurate.</p><p>He was an adult male with a substantial beard who showed up in the FYPs that people posted on Tiktok. He was a native of the United States, having been born and brought up in that country, and holding American citizenship.</p><p>Due to the tragic circumstances surrounding his passing, his loved ones and friends are currently grieving his passing. He was just getting started on the path to professional achievement when he decided to abandon the world.</p><p>In addition to this, he was a married man who brought a wife into the family. In his social media bio, he boasted about being the father of seven children, although he did not discuss their individual names.</p><p>Mccomas went on to say that some people could try to utilize free knowledge to overwhelm other people and make them feel as though they are unable to manage the task on their own. On the other hand, he was a walking example of the fact that free material can be utilized to sell paper.</p><p>According to reports, Paul was involved in a “horrific” accident, and he subsequently died as a result of his injuries while others were left gravely injured. The inquiry into the events that led up to the incident is still being carried out at this time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-58759 alt="Paul Mccomas" width=201 height=250 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Paul-Mccomas-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-58759 class=wp-caption-text>Paul Mccomas</p><h2>What Did Paul Mccomas Do to Make His Living and Accumulate His Net Worth?</h2><p>The majority of Paul Maccmons’ wealth was acquired through his work in real estate. Nevertheless, he was also a financial advisor, and people enjoyed watching his movies about many kinds of legal procedures.</p><p>It is common knowledge that those who work in the real estate industry earn a good living; hence, it was assumed that Paul had a successful profession that enabled him to provide a nice lifestyle for himself and his family.</p><p>The social media influencer’s wealth came not just from his real estate holdings but also from his popularity on the video-sharing website Youtube, where he had a sizeable following. The cash he made from his digital outlets was increased.</p><p>According to his assertions, he has made the instructional videos that are the shortest on how to sell the paper and posted them on his own YouTube account. This claim is made by a person who formerly held a blue-collar job and who worked independently for over 3.5 years to piece together the transaction.</p><p>Everyone was taken aback by the fact that Paul was a wholesaler who worked alone. The key to his success was always keeping things straightforward while maintaining a strict work ethic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6top5Kewbat0bJksKCfYra0ecitqqSZpJ6yprHBnpxmrJmgwbC3jKSYrZ2crrtuw9Srq7NllJqutbSMnJiuq5Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
