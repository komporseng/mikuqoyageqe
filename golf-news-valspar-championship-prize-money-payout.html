More began with a two stroke deficit going into the final round of the Valspar Championship. However, he managed to completely turn the around in the span of a few strokes, finishing the course with 10 under. He managed to edge out Schnek by 1 stroke.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Shut the f**k up,” Matt Wallace curses out caddie at the 2023 Valspar Championship, but this is not the first time</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-here-are-the-prize-money-payouts-for-the-2023-valspar-championship>Here are the Prize money payouts for the 2023 Valspar Championship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adobe_Express_20230321_1246070_1-1024x768.jpg><p>“Really solid player that’s been knocking on the door,” Spieth said&nbsp;talking about Moore’s first win. Moore too was elated after a fantastic victory. “I don’t think I’ve ever done anything close to that,” Moore said. “Just a testament to the work I’ve put in with my coach and my team and that was pretty sick to see.”</p><p>Moore’s play on the last day included back to back birdies, tying Schenk after trailing. He pulled out a complete masterclass, considering that he has not had a top 10 victory on the PGA Tour this entire season. Going into Valspar ranked 103rd in the world, it was a pleasant surprise to see him play so well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A ginormous “THANK YOU” to our fans, guests, sponsors, players, volunteers, interns and Copperheads for making the 2023 Valspar Championship one of the most memorable yet. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NP7dPfdVJM</a></p>— Valspar Championship (@ValsparChamp) <a href=#>March 20, 2023</a></figure><p>Talking about golf, he said, “Kind of fell in love with golf as I got older and just being in control of a little bit of everything instead of relying on teammates and umpires and things.
