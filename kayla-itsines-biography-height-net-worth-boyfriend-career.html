Itsines grew up in Australia. Her nationality is Australian, and she is of Greek-Australian heritage. Kayla’s dream job was to be a beauty therapist.</p><p>Basketball was her childhood passion, although she was underweight and unhealthy. A doctor warned Itsines when she was 15 that she might have reproduction troubles due to endometriosis.</p><p>After understanding that her infertility could be solved, Itsiness began working out at a gym. She became obsessed with exercise to the point where she abandoned her primary aim of becoming a beauty therapist.

Her plan was not to increase muscle or lose weight but to achieve a specific look.</p><p>In 2015, Itsines embarked on the ‘Kayla Itsines Bootcamp World Tour,’ to provide lead-free group fitness programs. She performed throughout Australia’s capital cities, as well as New York, Los Angeles, and London.
