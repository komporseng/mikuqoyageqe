The NFL star and his wife recently shared pictures and video footage of their son, Easton, earlier this week.</p><p>Miranda’s recording of her son laughing at the thought of greeting his fans was simply adorable. Mrs. Green tells her son to, “Say hi” in the video. Easton, however, cannot get over the hilarity of his mom smiling and waving. The little one lets off a few chuckles while greeting his public. “When ‘Say Hi!’ is just too funny,” Miranda captioned.</p><p>Another upload showed off AJ’s babysitting skills and ability to multitask. The NFL player was a bit preoccupied with his phone but was nevertheless standing in front of his son to keep little Easton company in the candid. “So blessed to have these two,” Miranda wrote in another post.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BOkQSYdBtqa/?taken-by=mirandabrooke_</p><p>It has been just over three months since Miranda and AJ Green welcomed their son. Little Easton was born on Thursday, September 22, 2016, and AJ shared his joys just hours after his son made entry.</p><p>“My sweet boy is here,” AJ told Instagram fans. He also told <a href=#>media</a>, “Just to see him come out and he’s crying, and when you hold him, he looks so innocent. You see this guy, and you’re going to have to raise him, that’s yours till death do y’all part. You helped create that and you’re going to have to show him the ropes.”</p><p>Easton is Miranda and AJ Green’s first child. The couple celebrated their first wedding anniversary earlier this year.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BOYXsyVB7ob/?taken-by=mirandabrooke_</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG9mampfZ4VwrclmnqudlaN6orrDZq6inpVisbDAxGamp2WjpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
