Before she married Tony, Laureen had been practicing her career but was not anywhere close to the limelight. It was, however, her marriage to the actor that earned her public attention. She has also maintained a decent presence in the limelight even after the death of her husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/Lauren-Shulkind-and-late-husband-Tony-Dow.jpg><h3><strong>What is Lauren Shulkind Dow’s Age?</strong></h3><p>Shulkind Dow’s age is 76 year old as of 2023. She was born on the 29th of September 1947 in New York City, United States of America. Her birth sign is Libra, and she is a Christian. She is an American national of a white ethnic background. Laureen was raised in her birthplace by her parents, whose identities are not revealed.</p><p>She reportedly has two siblings alongside whom she grew up. Lauren does not share much of her life and family information with the public, so nothing further is known about her early life and upbringing.</p><p>For her education, Lauren Shulkind attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School, after which she proceeded to the Kansas City Art Institute. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mosaic Art.</p><h2><strong>Lauren Shulkind’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>As of 2023, Lauren Shulkind’s net worth is estimated between $550,000 and $1 million. As earlier stated, she makes a living as a mosaic artist and that is known to be her primary source of income. She occasionally posts her admirable artwork on her social media platforms.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is also safe to believe that Lauren must have accrued her impressive net worth thanks to her marriage to Tony Dow whose net worth is estimated at $4 million at the time of his death. Moreover, Lauren Shulkind may also have one or a few other businesses she manages that are not public knowledge.</p><p>Currently, Shulkind works as a production coordinator at Mayfield Productions. Also, according to her Facebook profile, she is the vice president of Mayfield Productions. Some records also show that she once briefly worked as a model.</p><h2><strong>Lauren Shulkind was Tony Dow’s Wife Until His Death in 2022</strong></h2><p>Laureen Shulkind and Tony Dow’s marriage lasted for 42 years before Tony sadly passed away. Their marriage only ended with the death of Tony. The couple met for the first time in Kansas City in 1978. They got connected, fell in love with each and started a relationship. After dating for a little more than two years, they decided to take their love to the next level.</p><p>They got married on the 16th of June 1980 in Laguna Beach, California, United States, although the kind of wedding ceremony they had is not known. As long as their marriage lasted, Laureen and Dow lived together happily and peacefully and never courted any public marital crisis or scandal. Lauren was very supportive of her husband’s acting career throughout his active years.</p><p>The couple was occasionally pictured attending public events and red carpets together. Sadly, their marriage came to an end on the 27th of July, 2022, following the tragic death of her husband. Tony Dow was in May 2022 diagnosed with liver cancer, and a few months later, he passed away. His death was widely misreported a day before he actually died.</p><p>Lauren took to her Facebook page on the same day and announced his death, asking fans to keep them in their thoughts and prayers.</p><h2><strong>Before Lauren Shulkind, Tony was Previously Married</strong></h2><p>Laureen Shulkind was Tony Dow’s second wife. The late Hollywood actor and film producer was first married to Carol Marlow. They met and started dating in the early 1960s and later tied the knot on 14th July 1969. The union lasted for 11 years before they called it quits and went their separate ways in 1980.</p><p>There is not much information about this marriage, probably because it happened long ago and the fact that the actor’s second marriage to Laureen has since been represented in the public. Although the actual reason that necessitated the end of Tony Dow’s first marriage to Marlow was not made public, speculations had it that it might have been due to his clinical depression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/Tony.png><p>Dow revealed in the 1990s that he suffered from clinical depression. In an attempt to bring awareness to the issue of depression, especially among celebrities, Dow made appearances in self-help movies that detailed his struggle with depression, such as Beating the Blues.</p><h2><strong>Did Tony Dow Have Children With His Wife?</strong></h2><p>Tony Dow had one child, a son named Christopher Dow. He had him with his first wife, Carol Marlow. His 42-year-long marriage with his second wife, Lauren Shulkind, did not produce any children, and Lauren also does not have any children of her own. Notably, this did not deter the former couple from having a peaceful and long-lasting marriage. Laureen is now a stepmother to Christopher, although it is not clear the kind of relationship they have.</p><p>Christopher Dow was born on 26th March 1973 and is 50 years old as of 2023. Born into the spotlight, Christopher started working as a child actor and played a couple of roles on television. In 1985, he appeared three times in the Leave It to Beaver Spinoff. From 1988 to 1989, he played 16-year-old Wally Cleaver.</p><p>However, after these two TV appearances, Christopher disappeared from the screens and has never been seen anywhere in the entertainment industry again. He grew to become a very private person and does not have a presence on any social media platform, which has made it difficult to keep a tab on his life, including what he now does for a living.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmpZmlp7KvedKhrKWjmaOxbrHXqaOoqpmjtG7Ax55kpaGWmnqwsoytpqexXZm8uL%2BMsKCfnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
