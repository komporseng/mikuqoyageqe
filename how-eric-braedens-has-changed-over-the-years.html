Braeden was 39 when he was cast in <a href=#>the role that would make him famous</a>. Before his daytime television career, Braeden worked in primetime, including the series The Rat Patrol. But his career was about to change thanks to soap opera pioneer William J. Bell.</p><p>Initially, the role was to be short-term, lasting twelve weeks, with the storyline ending with Victor’s wife Julia Newman (Meg Bennett) killing him. However, Bell was impressed with Braeden’s performance; he decided to make Victor a permanent character. While Victor was a despicable man when first introduced, Bell redeemed him into one of Genoa City’s most respectable residents.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNHGzRwPRCk?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>‘The Young and the Restless’: Why Stars Like Eric Braeden and Peter Bergman May Not Return From Hiatus</a></strong></p><p>Victor’s switched from a villain to a good guy throughout the years.

The actor’s hair is greyer, but he still has the same mustache that’s become part of Victor’s iconic look.

After learning Ashland lied about his illness, Victor is determined to remove him from Victoria Newman’s (Amelia Heinle). As viewers expect, Victor has some tricks up his sleeves when dealing with his enemies.</p><p>While Victor’s focused on ruining Ashland, <a href=#>another Newman family feud is brewing</a> unbeknownst to him.
