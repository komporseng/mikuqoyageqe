You can get a first peek at our series in the one-hour special Magnolia Network: Look Ahead Vol. 2, dropping on&nbsp;@discoveryplus&nbsp;4/23 as part of the&nbsp;@magnolianetwork&nbsp;preview and a special airing on&nbsp;@diynetwork this Saturday, 4/24 at 8p|7c.‚Äù</p><p>Below, we will focus on his life of Brice. His age, job, net worth, family, and residence. And their cute love story, you should definitely read that too!</p><h3><strong>Brice Gilliam On Making Modern With Brooke And Brice</strong></h3><p>Brice Gilliam from Making Modern with Brooke and Brice is a self-taught designer. It was building their own house that gave them the feeling that they could get into the house renovation business.</p><p>His wife spent her time at the site learning from the subcontractors. The subcontractors weren‚Äôt used to having girls around so they invited her to learn how to make things. So, she ended up learning the trades of the business. She took a couple of projects from her friends and family.</p><p>Word of mouth, they started attracting clients and it became their full-time gig.</p><p>As for Magnolia‚Äôs show Making Modern, Brice told The List that one of his neighbors helped them to meet a TV producer (Sarah Kunin, a former producer for ABC) that was moving to Nashville. The producer offered him and his wife a chance to create a show and both Brooke and Brice agreed.</p><p>Brice added, ‚Äúshe was like, ‚ÄòWell, would you mind if I brought a production crew with me?‚Äô And then we were like, ‚ÄòYeah, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äô And next thing we know, we have our own show‚Äù.</p><p>One of the interesting things about their show is they are building a business as the show progresses. Brice is thrilled that a little idea in their head is manifesting into a big project and the show is helping to document their business.</p><p>Brice was also surprised by how much work goes into creating a show. It is two different businesses run simultaneously but not together. For him, that was the most surprising aspect of working on a TV show. But, it has been challenging for them because people reach out to Brooke thinking she is the designer which she calls the ‚Äúindustry norm‚Äù. And, with cameras following around it adds to that challenge and it took them a lot of time to get used to that.</p><p>For Brooke, the final product coming together (construction and TV show production) is surprising.</p><h3><strong>Brice And Brooke Gillian‚Äôs Relationship</strong></h3><p>Since August 2012, Brooke and Brice Gilliam have been wed. They probably first met in 2010 at a location named Cadillac Ranch in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, which is no longer there. While Brooke was at a bachelorette celebration with her pals, Brice was there with his buddies.</p><p>They had mutual friends in their respective groups and Brooke‚Äôs friend knew Brice. Brooke told The List, ‚ÄúWe knew we were the one for each other pretty quickly, and we were engaged seven months later and then got married right at that two-year mark of knowing each other. So we‚Äôve been together almost 10 years now‚Äù.</p><p>When Brice wants to give the story a twist, he would claim that he was the one who jumped out of the cake, but Brooke always refutes him because it never happened. Brice, on the other hand, believes that this makes the story sound much better. However, Brooke noted that they intended to recreate that on their tenth wedding anniversary.</p><p>But both of them agree that it was love at first sight.</p><p>Brice proposed seven months later, and they got married next year in August 2012. The couple celebrated their 9-year anniversary on 4 August 2021. On their joint account, Brice announced, ‚Äú9 years of the perfect balance ü§ç <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@abitofbrooke_</a>‚Äôs ability to bring warmth into any space she enters is what first drew me to her way back when I met her out at the Cadillac Ranch (the real Nashville natives will know).</p><p>He added, ‚ÄúHaving her by my side to ride this crazy wave of life is the most incredible blessing and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. They may call me the ‚ÄúSmile Creator,‚Äù but little do they know that she is the reason for my smile each and every day. We are truly ‚Äúbetter together.‚Äù Cheers to 9 years, baby. We‚Äôve got a lifetime to go‚Äù.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Brice Gilliam Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Brice Gilliam‚Äôs net worth should be above $600 thousand.

One client wrote, ‚ÄúKind service and affordable pricing have given me a great smile!‚Äù.</p><p>Another of their client added, ‚ÄúThis business is not only beautiful in the decor, but they make you feel beautiful. This company exceeded my expectations, especially since they had a lot to offer. Not only could they help me whiten my teeth, but they could inject botox into my forehead. Great service. incredible staff!‚Äù</p><p>Speaking to <a href=#>Incisal Edge Magazine</a>, he shared, ‚ÄúWhen people think of orthodontics, they typically think of kids and teens. We wanted to make a modern space for adults‚Äù. He added that he chose to keep a small staff size to ensure genuine, personal interactions with each patient.</p><p>Brooke, his wife, helped him build his 2,400-square-foot frame. ‚ÄúWe knew we needed an office that would not feel dental at all,‚Äù Dr. Brice said. ‚ÄúIt needed to feel mature, luxurious, and aesthetically pleasing. It would be hard to say, ‚ÄòHey, we‚Äôre going to do some aesthetic work on you‚Äîwithout an aesthetically pleasing space.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>Brice attended the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
